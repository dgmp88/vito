# VITO

Voice in, text out. Users speak to an agent which helps them draft a document.

Based on the [OpenAI Realtime agents demo](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-agents)

Possible future directions 

- Diagram building - e.g. using Mermaid diagrams 
- (Gratitude) journalling - easy way to add entries
- Forecasting - help users build 'guesstimate' style forecasts by mapping out different option spaces and assigning probabilities 


Tech improvements
- Persist conversations and documents 
  - 1 - just with cookies
  - 2 - login w supabase
- Instead of editing full document, provide a (git style?) diff, or find and replace with sed 
- Try out Gemini offerings - 2.5 voice is pretty good 
- Make it responsive - work on mobile
